                <h2>Personal</h2>
                <p>My name is Ayush, and I'm 18 years old. I was born and raised in Brampton, Canada, and I'm currently
                    pursuing a diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis at Humber College. I have a passion for
                    technology and a strong interest in coding and software development. In my free time, I enjoy playing
                    basketball, gaming, and watching movies. I'm always eager to learn new skills and expand my knowledge
                    in various areas, especially in programming and design.</p>

            <p>My primary goal is to become a skilled software developer. I aspire to work for a reputable tech company
                where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to grow as a professional. Additionally, I
                have a dream of starting my own business in the tech industry. I believe that entrepreneurship will allow
                me to create solutions that can positively impact people's lives. Ultimately, I aim to achieve financial
                stability while doing what I love.</p>
